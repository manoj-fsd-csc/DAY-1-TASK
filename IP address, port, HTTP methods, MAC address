IP Address:
An IP address is like a special address for your computer or phone on the internet.
 It's like your home's unique address, but for the digital world. Computers use IP
 addresses to find each other and communicate, just like sending letters to the right house.

Port:
Imagine a shipyard with different docks for different types of cargo. Ports in computers
 are a bit like these docks. They help different programs on your device communicate with 
each other. When data arrives at your device, the port helps decide which program should 
handle it, just like choosing the right dock for a shipment.

HTTP Methods:
When you visit a website, your computer sends requests to get information. These requests
 can be like asking for a page, sending data, or deleting something. HTTP methods are
 like the words you use to tell the website what you want to do. For example, "GET" asks 
for a page, "POST" sends new info, and "DELETE" removes something.

MAC Address:
Think of a MAC address as a serial number for your device's network card. It's unique to 
each device, like a fingerprint. When devices talk to each other in a local network, they
 use MAC addresses to know who's who. It's like recognizing your friends by their special 
secret handshake.
