objects are like containers that hold different kinds of information.
 Think of them as toolboxes where you keep tools of various shapes and sizes.
 Now, let's peek inside and see how objects work in JavaScript.

Objects in Simple Terms:
Imagine you're making a recipe book, and each recipe has ingredients and instructions.
 In JavaScript, objects help organize things like recipes. You put details inside them, 
like "name," "ingredients," and "steps." This way, you have all the recipe info in one place.

How Objects are Stored:
When you create an object, JavaScript has a clever way of storing it. It creates a special
 list that remembers where everything is in your object. This helps find things quickly, 
like knowing where your favorite toy is among a bunch of toys.

Inheriting Cool Stuff:
Objects can also share things with each other. It's like getting your older 
sibling's cool toys.This sharing happens through something called 
"prototypes." If your object doesn't have something,
 it looks at the prototype to find it.

Why It Matters:
Understanding how objects work on the inside helps you organize information better
 and use it efficiently.It's like knowing where all your game pieces are in a big
 board game â€“ you can play smoothly without searching everywhere.

To sum it up, objects in JavaScript are like mini-storage units that hold information.
 The way JavaScript stores and shares this info is smart, making coding easier and faster. 
So, the next time you create an object, remember that it's like making your very own recipe 
book in the world of code.
